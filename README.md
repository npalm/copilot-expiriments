# Copilot experiments

This repo contains several Copilot experiments. Each experiment is standalone and can be run independently.

Note the experiments are not meant to be used in production. They are just a way to demonstrate AI assistance in coding. Be-aware that GitHub tokens are used and shared in the browser application.

## Experiments

- [**`react-gh-repo-retro`**](./react-gh-repo-retro): A React app that fetches and displays a list of repositories from GitHub's API. The list is displayed in a retro style. Basic unit and integration tests are included.

- [**`react-gh-repo-paged`**](./react-gh-repo-paged): A React app that fetches and displays a list of repositories from GitHub's API. The list is paginated and the user can navigate through the pages. No tests, no CI/CD, and no effort on styling.

## Contributing

This repo is just an experiment and is not meant to be used at all. Expect no support or maintenance. The repo is public just for sharing knowledge and as demonstration.
